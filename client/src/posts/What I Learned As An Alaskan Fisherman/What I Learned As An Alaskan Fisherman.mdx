_The following are selections from the 80 letters I wrote to Caitlyn in the summer of 2014 while working for a commercial salmon fishing company in Kodiak, Alaska._

### 14 May 2014 - Kodiak Harbor

I am trying to think about things to share that I haven't already on the phone. Here in the harbor there is probably about a hundred large commercial fishing boats docked. Just about every evening we have seen sea lions come swim amongst the boats! They will surface from time to time. They are big and really fun to watch.

One frustrating experience has been when we are doing construction work like today. James and I have been helping another guy named Jeff. It's frustrating because both of them have experience with construction work and I don't. Sometimes I'll show my inexperience with some things and somehow its a big joke to them. It doesn't bother me too much but being the bottom guy on the totem pole can be frustrating after a long day. I think its just gives me incentive to learn the fishing stuff quickly.

### 26 May 2014 - Arriving on the Island

We arrived on Bear Island for the first time today. We took a flight from Kodiak to Larsen Bay then took a ride in the skiff to Bear Island. The scenery is beautiful but our island itself isn't much to look at. We got here and almost immediately started mending nets. A guy named Peter showed me how to tie the knots to med the nets and I think I'm getting the hang of it. Also it turns out that our cook is really good -- this had been great news. James and I were able to get a room together just the two of us which is nice.

### 28 May 2014 - Hiking

Because the season doesn't begin till the 9th, we are not able to send out mail everyday like we will be able to. Today was my second full day on the island. I am enjoying it. The work is pretty tedious. I mend nets most of the day. The nice thing is I get a break after lunch and I have been reading and napping. Maybe this summer I can learn to nap so I can enjoy many long naps next to you. I think a big part of passing the time and not going crazy will be the friendships. There is this guy name Luke who has been fun to get to know. Tonight after dinner me, James, Luke, and a guy named Micah hiked up to the highest point on the island. Its not that far but its still a good view up there. Luke said we were going to sprint to the top but we only got 3/4 of the way before we almost passed out breathless.

### 31 May 2014 - The Bana

The last two days have been tough has far as work goes. The weather has been pretty bad, a gale came in yesterday (when the wind blows really hard) and it was cold and rainy. But even though it hasn't been the best working conditions we've kept our spirits up.

Last night was my first shower here. But they don't just shower they use what they call a Bana. Basically, its a big sauna. We sit in there and sweat out all the nasty stuff then shower. It was super relaxing and I haven't felt so clean in my entire time here.
